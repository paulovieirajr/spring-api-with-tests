> ### Purpose

This is an application where I've learnt some initial concepts about tests using JUnit 5 and Mockito.

> ### How did I do ?

I've created a simple POJO called User and your respectives controller, service and repository.

Then I worked with some scenarios to test the application using both JUnit 5 and Mockito.

> ### Conclusion

As this was my first contact with JUnit5 and Mockito, it was a good learning. As a developer, I know tests are over important. Learning those kind of tools, helps us to 
write better programs.
